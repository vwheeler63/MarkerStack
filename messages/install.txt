MarkerStack is the missing tool for managing editing-task interruptions in
Sublime Text 3 and onward.

With it you can PUSH/POP cursor (caret) position in View with a single
keystroke.  Marker Stacks are kept PER VIEW, and their states are saved
across Sublime Text sessions.  Each View only stores MarkerStack information
until the stack becomes empty, and then that storage is removed again, i.e.
Views with no PUSHED cursor (caret) positions are not burdened with any
kind of storage, including across Sublime Text sessions.

Example Use
-----------

You realize you need to quickly change something ELSE in the file you are
editing before you forget it, so you PUSH your current cursor (caret) position
onto the Marker Stack, go do your edit elsewhere in the file, and then POP
your cursor position OFF the Marker Stack again, returning to exactly where
you left off:  cursor position, as well as viewport position.  Such
interruptions can be nested to any depth.

Using MarkerStack is significantly more efficient than setting a Bookmark for
interruptions such as the above, and doesn't leave you with the task of
cleaning up now-unused bookmarks.  It is designed for efficiently managing
temporary moves away from your current editing task.

Quick Start
-----------

Review the README and decide what keys you want to map the PUSH/POP functions
to.  A suggested `Default.sublime-keymap` key binding (commented out) is
included.  You can either uncomment what is there, and save it as
`Packages/User/Default.sublime-keymap` (or add its contents to your existing
`Packages/User/Default.sublime-keymap` if you already have one) or map commands
to the keys that feel most natural to you.

Menu
----

MarkerStack installs its own maintenance menu items:

Preferences > Package Settings > MarkerStack:

    README           (MarkerStack orientation)
    Settings         (documentation included)
    Key Bindings     (split view)
