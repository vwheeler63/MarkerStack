MarkerStack is the missing tool for managing editing-task interruptions in
Sublime Text 3 and onward.

With it you can PUSH your cursor (caret) position in a Sublime Text View with
one keystroke, go and handle something elsewhere in the same file, and then
POP your cursor position with another keystroke, to be right back where you
left off.

Marker Stack data is kept PER VIEW, and their states are saved across Sublime
Text sessions.

Using MarkerStack is significantly more efficient than setting a Bookmark for
interruptions such as the above, and doesn't leave you with the task of
cleaning up unused bookmarks.  It is designed for efficiently managing
temporary moves away from your current editing task.

Quick Start
-----------

Review the README and decide what keys you want to map the PUSH/POP functions to.
Via the menu, go to Preferences > Package Settings > Marker Stack > Key Bindings
and map your PUSH and POP keys (see README "Getting Started" section).
